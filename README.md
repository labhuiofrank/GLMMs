Models

**Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs)** are powerful tools commonly applied to ecological and evolutionary data to dissect variance at multiple scales spanning the environment (e.g. season and geography). GLMM provide a flexible means for appropriately dealing with the complex data structures and relationships between predictors of interest that arise in ecological data, such as over-dispersed count data, complicated experimental design structures, or interactions between key variables (Bolker et al. 2009)[^2]. GLMMs are specified with both **fixed effects** of experimental design or biological interest as well as **random effects** which estimate technical or biological variance from the population. 

Some helpful resources for better understanding GLMM model use from Kyle Edwards OCN 683 class.
